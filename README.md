Statistical Testing Results found in "significance_testing_results.txt"

NOTE: When running sims_n_plots.py, the proportions of the plots will be scaled wrong. This is due to setting dpi=300. The plots look correct in the Figs folder and the report. However, removing the dpi setting is also an option.
